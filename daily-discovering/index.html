            <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
            <h4>What is ACA health insurance?</h4>
            <p>
              The Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, is a
              federal law in the United States that aims to make health
              insurance more accessible and affordable for individuals and
              families. ACA health insurance plans are offered through
              state-based exchanges and provide essential health benefits, such
              as preventive care, hospitalization, and prescription drug
              coverage.
            </p>
            <h4>Who is eligible?</h4>
            <p>
              Most U.S. citizens and legal residents are eligible to enroll in
              ACA health insurance plans. Eligibility is based on factors such
              as income, family size, and other specific criteria. Individuals
              who do not have access to employer-sponsored health coverage or
              qualify for Medicaid may be eligible to purchase ACA plans through
              the marketplace.
            </p>
            <h4>When is the open enrollment period?</h4>
            <p>
              The open enrollment period for ACA health insurance typically runs
              from November to December of each year. During this time, you can
              enroll in a new plan or make changes to your existing coverage.
              However, certain life events, such as marriage, having a baby, or
              losing other health coverage, may qualify you for a special
              enrollment period outside of the regular open enrollment period.
            </p>
            <h4>What are essential health benefits covered?</h4>
            <p>
              ACA health insurance plans must cover essential health benefits,
              including preventive services, emergency services,
              hospitalization, prescription drugs, maternity and newborn care,
              mental health services, and more. These benefits help ensure that
              individuals and families have access to necessary medical services
              without facing excessive out-of-pocket expenses.
            </p>
            <h4>
              Can I get financial assistance with health insurance premiums?
            </h4>
            <p>
              Yes, many individuals and families may qualify for premium tax
              credits, also known as subsidies, to help lower the cost of ACA
              health insurance premiums. The amount of assistance is based on
              your income and family size. Our team of experts can help you
              determine if you qualify and assist you with the application
              process.
            </p>
            <h4>Are pre-existing conditions covered under ACA?</h4>
            <p>
              Yes, ACA health insurance plans must cover pre-existing
              conditions. This ensures that you can receive the necessary
              medical care without being denied coverage or charged higher
              premiums based on your health history.
